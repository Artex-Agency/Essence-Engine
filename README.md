  <b>ARTEX ESSENCE</b>

  <sup>FRAMEWORK &nbsp;ENGINE</sup>
</h1>

The **Artex Essence Engine** is a **[meta-framework](#meta-framework)** and **[framework engine](#framework-engine)** for rapidly building high-performing, flexible, and sustainable application frameworks using PHP 8. Designed for speed, adaptability, and maximum resource efficiency, Essence serves as the robust foundation upon which **[application frameworks](#application-framework)** are built.

## &#9888; PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT
This project is currently under active development. While it provides a foundational structure and initial components, it is not yet fully functional or production-ready. Features, configurations, and documentation are still being finalized, and significant updates are expected as development progresses.

## Definitions

### Meta-Framework
A **meta-framework** is a foundational system designed to build or bridge together other frameworks, providing essential tools and structures to streamline and accelerate development. Designed to be the foundation that all of the Artex Essence application frameworks are built upon.

### Framework Engine
A **framework engine** provides the core runtime environment, essential components, and foundational tools required to support and execute higher-level frameworks. Unlike a [meta-framework](#meta-framework), which offers structural guidance for building frameworks, a framework engine actively powers the frameworkâ€™s operations, managing resources, executing low-level processes, and optimizing performance. The Artex Essence Engine is designed to handle these backend processes efficiently, providing a powerful, adaptable base upon which customized frameworks can be built and run seamlessly.
